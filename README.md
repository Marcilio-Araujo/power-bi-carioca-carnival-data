# Power BI Project -- Exercises 03, 04, and 05

This repository contains a Power BI report developed as part of a
training module focused on building analytical dashboards, exploring
data modeling techniques, and creating meaningful visual insights. The
file **`projeto - aulas 03 - 04 - 05 - exercícios.pbix`** consolidates
the activities and practical exercises completed across three classes,
each emphasizing different aspects of the Power BI ecosystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply hands-on learning in Power BI by
developing a complete analytical report that includes:

-   Data ingestion and transformation using **Power Query**
-   Data modeling best practices, including relationships and
    star-schema concepts
-   Creation of calculated columns and measures using **DAX**
-   Design of interactive reports and dashboards
-   Implementation of slicers, filters, and navigation elements
-   Use of themes, custom visuals, and visual best practices

The exercises simulate real-world business scenarios and demonstrate how
data can be transformed into actionable insights.

## 🧩 Key Features Included

### 1. Data Preparation & Modeling

-   Cleaning and transforming source tables
-   Removing inconsistencies and standardizing fields
-   Creating a structured data model with appropriate cardinality
-   Implementing calculated columns and DAX measures for KPIs

### 2. DAX Measures & Calculations

Examples of the metrics developed throughout the exercises include:

-   **Time-intelligence metrics** (YoY, MoM, cumulative totals)
-   **Performance metrics** such as totals, averages, and percentage
    changes
-   **Business indicators** aligned with the dataset's domain

### 3. Report Pages & Visualizations

The PBIX includes multiple report pages containing:

-   Interactive charts and tables
-   Cards summarizing key performance indicators
-   Map visualizations (when applicable)
-   Dynamic slicers for intuitive filtering
-   A consistent and professional visual theme

### 4. User Experience Enhancements

-   Organized navigation
-   Clean and minimalistic design
-   Intuitive layout and color usage
-   Descriptive tooltips and labels
